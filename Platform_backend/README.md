## <a name="has_per">HasPermissionKey usage</a>

This permission class is located in `roles.permissions` if you acces it from any other app, if you are trying to import this class in roles app, you can just use `.permissions`.

This class has two parts, one function (`has_permission()`) and the class itself (`HasPermissionKey`). It's based on a RBAC (Role Based Access Control), that you can see as "keychains", a keychain equals a role and each key equals an action that a role can perform.

In this case, we use a model called PermissionKey, which contains three relevant parts to this manner: the scope, the entity and the action. When you create a key, it follows this naming structure: `<scope>:<entity_id>:<action>` (e.g. `node:22:get`). It connects to the user through `WorkspaceMembership`, `Role` and `RolePermission`. `RolePermission` stores `Role` and it's `PermissionKey`, and `WorkspaceMembership` stores `User`,`Role` and `Workspace`.

To use this permission class, you have to make sure to put it in your viewset, in `permission_classes`, it already includes `IsAuthenticated` and `IsAdminUser` permissions. 

### Example
```python
class GatewayViewSet(viewsets.ModelViewSet):
    queryset = Gateway.objects.all()
    serializer_class = GatewaySerializer
    permission_classes = [HasPermissionKey] # Here, no need for IsAdminUser or IsAuthenticated
```
NOTE: you have to verify the context of the viewset. (e.g. You don't need a key for `PermissionKey`, in that case you use `IsAdminUser` and `IsAuthenticated`.)
