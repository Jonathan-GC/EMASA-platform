## <a name="env_var">Environment variables</a>

|Name|Description|
|----|----|
|DEBUG| Default=False|
|SECRET_KEY| Django's secret key|
|DATABASE_URL| Url for the used database |
|ALLOWED_HOSTS| If you're testing, you can write here your localhost|
|DB_PREFIX| Prefix used in the naming of the DB tables |

### <a name="db_prefix">DB Prefix usage </a>

(UPDATE) Just add it to your .env, can be whatever you need it to be. (Make sure you name it something like `your_prefix_` end it with a "_")

### <a name="env_template">Default .env template</a>

This file should be created where your manage.py file is located, **please don't forget to modify the fields according to your needs**.

```ini
DEBUG=True 
SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key
DATABASE_URL=postgres://user:password@localhost:5432/test_db # Adjust this to your needs, if it doesn't work, change postgres for postgresql or your port, check the docker-compose.yml file
DB_PREFIX=test_monitor_ # See DB Prefix usage for more information
ALLOWED_HOSTS=127.0.0.1, localhost
```


## <a name="setup">Backend setup</a>

This is a guide step by step to set up the backend in your environment.
1. Setup the database with docker, you can use the `docker-compose.yml` file, but change the ports if you are already using those or if you don't like 5432 number, it can happen and I get it, it's an ugly number üò†.
1. Make sure you're using python 3.12+ ‚ÄºÔ∏è
1. Clone this repository in a directory of your preferenceüìÇ, it's important for you to use the `backend` branch.
    https://github.com/Jonathan-GC/EMASA-platform.git
1. Create a virtual environment where this `README.md` is located and activate it.
---
### Windows
```bash
python -m venv venv
```
```bash
venv\Scripts\activate
```
Note: Rename the virtual environment if you like, or just copy and paste those up here ‚¨ÜÔ∏è.
### Linux
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
```
```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```
---
5. Now, install the `requirements.txt`
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
6. Try to use the django shell to make sure everything is working. Otherwise you might need to pull again or report this issue.
```bash
python manage.py shell
```
7. If everything is fine, proceed with migrating. First makemigrations, to make sure there's no pending migrations to make, then migrate.
```bash
python manage.py makemigrations && python manage.py migrate
```
8. Then, and only then, create a super user üòä (follow django instructions)
```bash
python manage.py createsuperuser
```
9. Now, run it :v
```bash
python manage.py runserver
```
Note: at this point, if you get the allowed hosts error, check if your .env is working.

10. Go to /admin/ and log in with the super user you created in step 8.

## <a name="docs">API Docs (Swagger, ReDoc)</a>

For endpoints or API Docs you can access `/api/schema/swagger-ui/` for swagger or `/api/schema/redoc/`. 

## <a name="auth">Authentication with EchoAPI</a>

There's an *üìÇAuth* folder in EchoAPI's: **üìÇMonitor | Emasa**. There you can found 2 elements: *Get tokens* and *Refresh Token*. Make sure the server is running (`python3 manage.py runserver`)

### Get tokens:

In Get Tokens: replace username and pasword in Body > raw with the username and password you created during the instalation with `createsuperuser`, if you don't remember that combination, repeat that step and just create another user.

```json
    {
        "username": "your_username",
        "password": "your_password"
    }
```
Send the request, the result should be 2 tokens: Access token, Refresh token. Acording to our settings.py jwt config, access token are only valid for 20 minutes, you'll have to auth again or proceed with **Refresh token**‚¨áÔ∏è.

### Refresh tokens

In Refresh Tokens: replace refresh in Body > raw with your refresh token.

```json
    {
    "refresh":"your_refresh_token"
    }
```
The result should be a new access token.

### Token usage

In any request you want to make (eg. `infrastructure_api_v1_node_list`) go to Auth set *Type* to "Bearer token" and paste your access token in the *Token* textfield, make sure the token is new or not expired. The result, depending on the user you got the token with (permissions), should be 200 OK.

## <a name="has_per">HasPermissionKey usage</a>

This permission class is located in `roles.permissions` if you acces it from any other app, if you are trying to import this class in roles app, you can just use `.permissions`.

This class has two parts, one function (`has_permission()`) and the class itself (`HasPermissionKey`). It's based on a RBAC (Role Based Access Control), that you can see as "keychains", a keychain equals a role and each key equals an action that a role can perform.

In this case, we use a model called PermissionKey, which contains three relevant parts to this manner: the scope, the entity and the action. When you create a key, it follows this naming structure: `<scope>:<entity_id>:<action>` (e.g. `node:22:get`). It connects to the user through `WorkspaceMembership`, `Role` and `RolePermission`. `RolePermission` stores `Role` and it's `PermissionKey`, and `WorkspaceMembership` stores `User`,`Role` and `Workspace`.

To use this permission class, you have to make sure to put it in your viewset, in `permission_classes`, it already includes `IsAuthenticated` and `IsAdminUser` permissions. 

### Example
```python
class GatewayViewSet(viewsets.ModelViewSet):
    queryset = Gateway.objects.all()
    serializer_class = GatewaySerializer
    permission_classes = [HasPermissionKey] # Here, no need for IsAdminUser or IsAuthenticated
```
NOTE: you have to verify the context of the viewset. (e.g. You don't need a key for `PermissionKey`, in that case you use `IsAdminUser` and `IsAuthenticated`.)
